# Analysis-Algorithm-Maximum-Rent-Stand

This project is about selecting selling stands with no two stands next to each other while maintaining the maximum rental cost. The project also includes code to plot the algorithm's running time for various input sizes. 

This project is a simple task for an algorithm analysis course in a master's degree program.

#description
The script reads an input `n` (number of houses) and a list of `rents` (the rent of each house). It uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum rent collectible. Additionally, it measures and plots the algorithm's running time as the input size varies.
